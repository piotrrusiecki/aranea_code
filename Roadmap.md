- [ ] Posture recovery using IMU feedback
- [ ] Dancing composite moves and sequences
- [ ] Beat detection and rhythm-based movement

### Feedback Systems
- [ ] LED status indicators and feedback patterns
- [ ] Local speech feedback (espeak integration)
- [ ] Buzzer alert patterns for different states

## Phase 5: External Integration (Priority: LOW)
### APIs & Control
- [ ] REST API for external control
- [ ] WebSocket interface for real-time communication
- [ ] Git auto-updater in web interface
- [ ] Remote debugging capabilities

### Data & Logging
- [ ] Persistent logging (SQLite/file-based)
- [ ] Battery usage graphs and trend analysis
- [ ] Movement pattern recording and playback
- [ ] Routine recorder and editor via web UI

## Phase 6: Advanced Features (Priority: FUTURE)
### Sensors & Hardware
- [ ] LiDAR integration for advanced navigation
- [ ] Camera-based object recognition
- [ ] Additional sensor integration framework

### AI & Learning
- [ ] Voice command learning and adaptation
- [ ] Movement optimization based on terrain
- [ ] Behavioral pattern recognition

## Maintenance & Quality Assurance (Ongoing)
### Testing & Deployment
- [ ] Comprehensive test suite development
- [ ] Regression testing framework
- [ ] Fresh install deployment scripts
- [ ] Documentation and user guides

### Code Quality
- [ ] DeepSource issue resolution (ongoing)
- [ ] Type hints addition to critical modules
- [ ] Performance profiling and optimization
- [ ] Security audit and hardening
